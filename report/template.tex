%What was the role of the client(s)? (I.e., did they supervise only, or did they participate in doing development) 
Our clients, ON Semiconductor requested that we research and implement computer
vision algorithms to be able to detect street signs from video or still images
intended to be captured from a low cost camera inside an automobile. The 
algorithms were required to run on low cost development boards like the 
Beaglebone Black and the NVIDIA Jetson TK1. ON Semiconductor recently acquired
Aptina, the leading producer of CMOS image sensors and hope to enter into the
Automotive Safety industry sometime in the future. They intended this to be a 
research project in which we can research, develop and test a variety of stop 
sign detection algorithms and analyze them to determine which algorithms seem
most promising, which development boards are most promising and provide a base 
for future senior design projects to contribute to.

Our clients at ON Semiconductor were Matthew Zochert, Carl Price and Don Reid.
The members of our team were Joshua Deare, Lane Breneman and Hari Caushik. 
Throughout the year, we each contributed to the creation of the algorithm 
development framework, testing framework, capturing of images and video for 
the test dataset and presenting our work. Our clients tracked our progress,
provided suggestions for our algorithms, use of hardware, and the presentation
of our work and even provided us with starter code early on to ramp up on 
programming with the OpenCV C++ library.
